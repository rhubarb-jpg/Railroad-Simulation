# Railway Simulation Model in AnyLogic

This project is a railway simulation model built using AnyLogic. It simulates the operations of a railway system, including train movement, scheduling, and resource utilization. The model provides insights into the performance of the railway system and can be used for optimization and decision-making.

## Features

- **Train Movement**: Trains move along the tracks based on their schedules and the current state of the railway network.
- **Network Representation**: The railway network is represented using nodes (stations) and edges (tracks) connecting them. Each track has properties such as capacity, speed limit, and signaling.
- **Scheduling**: Trains are scheduled to depart from stations and follow predefined routes. Schedules can be adjusted to optimize system performance.
- **Resource Allocation**: Resources such as platforms, tracks, and signaling systems are allocated dynamically to trains based on their requirements and availability.
- **Event-driven Simulation**: The simulation progresses through discrete time steps, with events triggering changes in the system state.
- **Performance Analysis**: Various performance metrics such as average travel time, throughput, and resource utilization are calculated to evaluate system efficiency.
- **Visualization**: AnyLogic provides powerful visualization tools to visualize the movement of trains, the state of the railway network, and performance metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the AnyLogic project files.
2. Open the project in AnyLogic.
3. Ensure that you have AnyLogic installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Open the AnyLogic project file (.alp) in the AnyLogic development environment.
2. Configure simulation parameters such as network topology, train schedules, and simulation duration.
3. Run the simulation in AnyLogic.
4. Monitor the simulation progress using built-in visualization tools.
5. Analyze the simulation results to gain insights into the performance of the railway system.

## Example

To run the simulation, simply open the AnyLogic project file (`Discrete Simulation COSC459.alp`) and follow the instructions provided within the model.
