# Railroad-Simulation
# Discrete Event Simulation Railway Model

This project is a discrete event simulation (DES) of a railway system. It simulates the movement of trains along a network of tracks, stations, and junctions. The goal of the simulation is to analyze the performance of the railway system under various conditions and to optimize its operations.

## Features

- **Train Generation**: Trains are generated at specific intervals and dispatched onto the railway network.
- **Network Representation**: The railway network is represented using nodes (stations) and edges (tracks) connecting them. Each track has a capacity and a speed limit.
- **Train Movement**: Trains move along the tracks based on their assigned routes and the current traffic conditions.
- **Event-driven Simulation**: The simulation progresses through discrete time steps, with events triggering changes in the system state.
- **Scheduling**: Trains are scheduled to depart from stations and allocated routes based on available resources and constraints.
- **Performance Metrics**: Various performance metrics such as average travel time, throughput, and resource utilization are calculated to evaluate system efficiency.
- **Visualization**: Visualization tools are provided to visualize the movement of trains and the state of the railway network in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/railway-simulation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd railway-simulation`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the simulation script: `python simulation.py`
2. Configure simulation parameters such as network topology, train schedules, and simulation duration.
3. Monitor the simulation progress and analyze the results.

## Example

```python
from railway_simulation import RailwaySimulation

# Initialize simulation with network parameters
simulation = RailwaySimulation(network_file='network.json', schedule_file='schedule.csv')

# Run simulation for 1000 time steps
simulation.run_simulation(1000)

# Analyze simulation results
simulation.analyze_results()
